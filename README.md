# Deep-Learning-for-Sentiment-Analysis
Consists of a Deep Learning model to do Sentiment Analysis over Amazon reviews data-set.<br/>
We have used 2 models to do the same<br/>
* Bi-Directional LSTM
* Temporal Convolutional Networks<br/>

Alongside we have compared the training accuracy & validation accuracy for both models in order to showcase the best model for this use-case.
<br/>
Pre-requisite for the following is:<br/>
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Basics of Deep Learning
* Models of Deep Learning
* Basics of Matplot

Optional:<br/>
* Understanding of numpy
* Pandas Data Frame
* gensim or word2vec(Google Code)

I would strongly recommend to go through word2vec once, since it'll help you understand few of the steps really well and you'll be able to process what actually is going on.<br/>
Make sure your python is installed and working correctly.<br/>
Install the following before starting the to run the notebook:<br/>
* Jupyter Notebook
* Gensim
* Matplotlib
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn

You can run the following command to do so:</br>
### pip install jupyter notebook gensim matplotlib pandas numpy sklearn ###
